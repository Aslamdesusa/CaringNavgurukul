After the extensive use of harmful firecrackers or non-biodegradable items such as plastic decoration items and thermocol plates — every year, after the merriment comes to a halt, most cities have a cover of smog for a couple of days.<br><br>In several areas, especially the National Capital, firecrackers have been banned for some time to control the pollution levels.
